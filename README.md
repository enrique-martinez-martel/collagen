## "6SigmaRoom Model" directory contains two files. 
    -The first one is the "client" directory which contains another 2 files "SimpleClientExample_Matlab.m" and "SimpleClientExample_Matlab.room". The first file is a small example providen by FutureFacilities in order to understand how the model works, it can be open with matlab. The second one is an example of a small datacenter and it can be open with the 6SigmaRoom software.
    -The second one is the "DatacenterModelSigma.room" file, it can only be opened if you have access to the 6SigmaRoom software. It contains the model and design of our practical demonstration.

## "Matlab Agent" directory contains two files. 
    -The first one is the "collagenSim.slx" file and its the environment in which our agent trains.
    -The second one is the "RLsetupRun.mlx" it contains the initialization, training options and set up that our artificial neural network uses to train.
